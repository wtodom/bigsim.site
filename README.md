# bigsim.site

A tool to generate combined raid, m+, and crafted item droptimizer strings for SimulationCraft.

## TODO
- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/screenreaders/
- Maybe use context rather than passing state through lots of components: https://stackoverflow.com/a/53455474
- disallow generating if not addon output is not valid
- disallow generating crafted items with no stats chosen
- add notification/warning if only 1 stat chosen for crafted items
- maybe switch to bootstrap toasts rather than react-toastify
